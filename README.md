# zkminer

Multi-zkVM, multi-GPU-vendor ZK proof generator for Hemi's ZK proving marketplace
(HemiProve).

zkminer watches the marketplace for open proving jobs, estimates whether each one is
worth taking, claims the ones that are, generates the proof on a local GPU, and submits
it on-chain. Proving runs in separate worker processes — one per GPU — so a wedged or
OOM-killed prover can't take the miner down with it.

Backends: **RISC Zero** (CUDA and ROCm), **SP1**, **OpenVM**.

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| Rust | 1.93.0 (pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`) |
| RISC Zero toolchain | `rzup`, see below — **required to build, and to prove** |
| CUDA | toolkit with `nvcc` (12.8–13.x tested) for NVIDIA workers |
| ROCm | 6.4+ with `hipcc` for AMD workers |
| Build deps | `build-essential cmake pkg-config protobuf-compiler libclang-dev` (+ `libhipcub-dev librocthrust-dev` for ROCm) |
| Foundry | `cast` — only for the example job submitters under `examples/` |

### RISC Zero toolchain (easy to miss)

Two `rzup` components are needed, and they fail at different stages:

```bash
curl -sSL https://risczero.com/install | bash
export PATH="$HOME/.risc0/bin:$PATH"
rzup install rust            # builds the guest ELFs — without it, cargo build fails
rzup install risc0-groth16   # the Groth16 wrap — without it, every PROOF fails
```

`risc0-groth16` is the nastier of the two: everything compiles and benchmarks fine
without it, and only real proofs fail — reported by the host as the unhelpful
`Worker risc0 process died (EOF)`.

## Build

```bash
cargo build --release -p zkminer-cli        # the CLI; no GPU toolchain needed
```

GPU prover workers are separate binaries, built with the toolchain for their vendor:

```bash
# NVIDIA. NVCC/HIPCC must be set explicitly: sppark's build.rs resolves them with
# which::which(), not PATH. Set the other to "off" so it isn't auto-detected.
env NVCC=/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc HIPCC=off \
    NVCC_APPEND_FLAGS="--expt-relaxed-constexpr -gencode arch=compute_120,code=sm_120" \
    cargo build --release -p zkminer-prove-risc0 --features cuda \
                --bin zkminer-prove-risc0-cuda --target-dir target/release-cuda

# AMD. Use a SEPARATE --target-dir from the CUDA build to avoid lock contention.
env HIPCC=/opt/rocm/bin/hipcc NVCC=off RISC0_HIP_ARCH="gfx1100" \
    cargo build --release -p zkminer-prove-risc0 --features rocm \
                --bin zkminer-prove-risc0-rocm --target-dir target/release-rocm
```

Never set `RISC0_SKIP_BUILD=1` — it produces empty guest ELF stubs, and every
benchmark then silently reports zero work.

`make` wraps portable Docker builds: `make cli | cuda | rocm | sp1 | openvm | all | test`.

## Install the workers

The miner looks for worker binaries in `~/.zkminer/provers/` under exact names. **The
directory is hand-managed: a missing binary means that backend is silently skipped, with
no error.**

```
~/.zkminer/provers/
├── zkminer-prove-risc0-cuda
├── zkminer-prove-risc0-rocm
├── zkminer-prove-sp1
├── sp1-gpu-server
└── zkminer-prove-openvm
```

**SP1** needs two more things, both handled for you:

- `sp1-gpu-server` ships beside `zkminer-prove-sp1`, built from the same hemilabs/sp1 commit as
  the worker. The worker installs it as `~/.sp1/bin/sp1-gpu-server`, where the SP1 SDK runs it
  from; without it the SDK downloads upstream's server, which lacks the fork's GPU fixes. Keep it
  beside the real binary, not a wrapper script. `ZKMINER_SP1_SERVER_INSTALL=0` leaves
  `~/.sp1/bin` alone, for a server you manage yourself.
- The Groth16 circuit artifacts (~8 GB, in `~/.sp1/circuits/groth16/`) are downloaded once, when
  the miner starts, before it claims any SP1 job; until then SP1 jobs are skipped. A download cut
  short is detected and redone. Final Groth16 proofs on one host take turns through lock files in
  `~/.zkminer/locks/` (hemilabs/sp1 v6.8.1 and later).

If a worker needs environment the miner's own process won't have (a systemd unit or cron
job does *not* source `~/.bashrc`), install a small wrapper script under the expected
name that sets it up and then `exec`s the real binary — `exec` preserves the PID and
process group the dispatcher relies on.

## Configure

Copy or write `~/.zkminer/config.toml`:

```toml
[chain]
rpc_url  = "https://testnet.rpc.hemi.network/rpc"
chain_id = 743111                   # Hemi testnet (43111 is mainnet)

[contracts]
hemi_prove          = "0x..."       # router (diamond proxy)
hemi_prove_staking  = "0x..."
hemi_prove_registry = "0x..."
hemi_token          = "0x..."

[wallet]
key_source  = "env"                 # reads $ZKMINER_PRIVATE_KEY
key_env_var = "ZKMINER_PRIVATE_KEY"

[prover]
max_concurrent_proofs = 0           # 0 = one proof per detected GPU
skip_benchmark_gate   = true
```

`zkminer init` will scaffold a config, but **verify the contract addresses it writes
against the deployment you intend to use** before running against a live market — a
wrong address set produces a miner that starts cleanly, sees no jobs, and has no stake.

## Run

```bash
export ZKMINER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...

zkminer status                # balance, stake, collateral, job stats
zkminer benchmark             # measure real per-GPU proving throughput
zkminer benchmark --calibrate # also measure segment size (po2); saves benchmarks.json
zkminer run                   # interactive TUI
zkminer -v run --headless     # headless; -v shows per-job claim/skip reasoning
```

Verbosity is `-v`/`-vv` **before** the subcommand (`RUST_LOG` is ignored). Logs go to
stderr, so `zkminer benchmark --json` on stdout stays machine-readable.

Two things worth knowing:

- **Don't run `benchmark` while the miner is running.** Both spawn a worker per GPU and
  the GPU lock is per-process, so they will double-book VRAM.
- **If the miner sits idle with jobs available, suspect collateral.** Available
  collateral is `staked − locked`, and a claimed job that passes its deadline locks
  collateral permanently. This surfaces as a throttled warning at default verbosity.

`benchmark --calibrate` measures proving time at each segment size and only overrides the
SDK's own choice when one size wins by a decisive margin — differences inside measurement
noise are discarded rather than acted on.

## Layout

| crate | role |
|---|---|
| `zkminer-cli` | binary entry point: `status`, `benchmark`, `run`, `init` |
| `zkminer-chain` | chain client, auction math, staking, monitor, tx/nonce layer, RPC metering |
| `zkminer-contracts` | `sol!()` bindings — the source of truth for the on-chain ABI |
| `zkminer-prover` | worker dispatcher, ELF registry, benchmarks, guest programs |
| `zkminer-prover-protocol` | worker↔dispatcher IPC types |
| `zkminer-prove-risc0` / `-sp1` / `-openvm` | standalone GPU worker binaries |
| `zkminer-strategy` | profitability evaluation, cost model, timing prediction |
| `zkminer-tui` | ratatui interface |
| `zkminer-config` | TOML config and wallet key loading |

RISC Zero and SP1 are patched to the `hemilabs` forks (GPU + AMD support) via
`[patch.crates-io]`, pinned by `Cargo.lock`. **Don't run `cargo update`** — those two are
referenced by moving branch heads, so the lockfile is what holds the build on validated
commits. (sppark is pinned by immutable rev and is not exposed to that drift.)

## Testing

```bash
cargo test                                    # unit + integration
ZKVM_ALLOW_SKIP=1 cargo test                  # skip tests needing GPUs/guest ELFs

# comprehensive zkVM suite — dispatches to the installed GPU workers
cargo test -p zkminer-prover --features risc0,sp1 --test comprehensive_zkvm_test \
    -- --test-threads=1 --nocapture
```

The zkVM suite is **fail-closed**: a missing worker or guest ELF fails the test rather
than skipping, so a half-installed box can't look green. Set `ZKVM_ALLOW_SKIP=1` to skip
instead. Run it single-threaded to avoid GPU contention, and log to a file rather than
piping to `tail`, which buffers and can hide a hang.

## Examples

`examples/` holds job submitters for testing against a live market. They read their
signing key from the environment (`SUBMITTER_KEY`, `REQUESTER_KEY`) and refuse to run
without it — never commit a funded key. The forge-based submitters additionally need
`CONTRACTS_DIR` pointing at a HemiProve Foundry checkout; `testnet_submitter_cast.sh`
needs only `cast`.
